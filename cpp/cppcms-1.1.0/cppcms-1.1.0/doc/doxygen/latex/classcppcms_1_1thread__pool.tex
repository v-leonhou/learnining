\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class provides an access to the thread pool where all Cpp\+C\+MS synchronous applications are executed. 

Users of asynchronous applications or tasks my send their jobs for the execution in the \doxyref{thread\+\_\+pool}{p.}{classcppcms_1_1thread__pool}

Cancel the job using id received from \doxyref{post()}{p.}{classcppcms_1_1thread__pool_a64241f11e253edad29903d847d072b0f} function

Returns true if the job was removed from the queue and false if the operation failed\+: the job execution is in the process or completed

Note\+: the id is just a rolling number and job ids may be repeated once in a while, so it is good idea to check if the job was completed before cancelling the job (even it is unlikely the 4 billion jobs would be executed in small period of time. \index{cppcms\+::thread\+\_\+pool@{cppcms\+::thread\+\_\+pool}!post@{post}}

Post a request for execution of {\itshape job} in the pool. Received integer is special job identification number that can be used to remove the job from the queue.
